<h3>The Our Father</h3>
<p>Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be

trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into 
temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>

<p>Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and 
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners 
now and at the hour of our death Amen.</p>  

<h3>Glory Be to the Father</h3>
<p>Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is 
now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>  

<h3>Fatima Prayer</h3>
