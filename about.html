    <p>Welcome to "Truth To Light" - a place where I share about the Catholic faith, college life, and anything that holds significance for people. 
        I'm Calvin, and I couldn't be more excited to have you here.</p>
    <p>As a passionate Catholic, I graduated college with a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Computer Science, and
         I'm proud to be one of the co-founders of the Catholic club in my school.</p>
    <p>College has had a profound impact on my faith, and now I'm here to share what 
        I've learned. I'll provide tips, opinions, and thoughts on navigating college 
        life.Meanwhile, I'll also delve into various media forms to discuss what it means 
        to be Catholic,offer catechesis, and explore other related topics. 
        This blog serves also as a  tool for me to learn more about computer science 
        and how to Code.</p>
    <p>The reason I named this Blog truth to Light is that I firmly believe in the power of truth 
        will set us free, to see the light and the world clearly.  Just like in Plato's "Allegory 
        of the Cave," where prisoners could only see shadows until one of them was set free, discovered 
        the source of the light, and saw the truth. His ignorance was dispelled, and he embarked on a journey 
        of enlightenment. In the end, he chose to return to the cave to share what he had learned.</p>

    <p>Although I may not be a theologian, preacher, coach, leader, teacher, or an expert, 
        I hope that through this blog, I can share what I believe to be the truth and journey 
        towards the light together.</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining me on this path of discovery and enlightenment. 
        Let's uncover the truth and find our way to the light together.</p>
