<h3>The Apostles’ Creed</h3>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty creator of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, 
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died,
    and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and
    is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. 
    I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the 
    resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.” </p>


<h3>The Our Father</h3>
<p>Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be 
done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our 
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into 
temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>  

<h3>The Hail Mary </h3>
<p>Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and 
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners 
now and at the hour of our death Amen.</p>  

<h3>Glory Be to the Father</h3>
<p>Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is 
now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>  

<h3>Fatima Prayer</h3>
<p>O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, 
and lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of Thy mercy. Amen</p>

<h3>Guardian Angel Prayer</h3>
<p>Angel of God, my guardian dear, To whom God's love commits me here, Ever this day, be at my side, 
To light and guard, Rule and guide. Amen. Angel of God, my guardian dear, To whom God's love commits 
me here, Ever this day, be at my side, To light and guard, Rule and guide.</p>

<h3>St Michael Prayer</h3>
<p>St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. 
    May God rebuke him we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly host, by the power of God, 
    cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.</p>
