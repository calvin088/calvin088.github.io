<ul>
    <li>
    Prayer comes from the root word <em>precari,</em> which means "to ask" or "to entreat" another individual for something.
     One could Pray to Saints or God (we will focus on God today and saints for another time.)
    </li>   
    <li>Many times, when people think of praying to God, they are actually thinking of petitionary prayer, a type of prayer where we ask God for something, such as help, guidance, or blessings.
        But that is not all prayer is. Prayer is a conversion with God through the act of adoration. 
        It is about expressing our relationship with God, where we lift our hearts and minds to him, offering praise, thanksgiving, repentance, and requests.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why do we pray?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>God will answer our prayers most definitely, but sometimes, it is not how we want it. God is not a genie that he grants every command a person makes. God sometimes can say yes or no, or occasionally, we just have to be patient (and then ask for the virtue of patience).
    </li>
    <li>So, what is the point of prayer if sometimes God doesn't answer our prayers? 
        Well, because we need prayer to live. St. John Vianney (curé d'Ars), patron saint of priests,
         says, <em>"He who does not pray deprives himself of what is indispensable for life."</em>
            Prayer is like oxygen for our souls; without it, we cannot live. We need God to thrive, 
            and prayer connects us to Him. Without prayer, we won't be close to God, and when we are not
             close to God, evil and temptations will engulf us and lead us into a path of sin. As St. Paul 
             says, <em>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
              let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep 
              your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."</em>(Philippians 4:6-7). When we pray, we put our trust in God to make 
              everything alright, and in doing so, we keep our hearts and minds to God and be on the path of holiness. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>When (and where) do we pray</h3> 

<ul>
    <li>Just like we need oxygen constantly, we need to pray continuously. 
        As St. Paul said, <em>"Pray without ceasing"</em>(1 Thessalonians 5:17); 
        now, that doesn't mean to be like a monk and pray 24/7, but it means that 
        throughout your day, you need God to be present in your life. The prayer can 
        last an hour to even 5 seconds. From when you wake up in the morning to when you go 
        outside; When you eat your meals to when you have to study, cry, laugh. God must 
        be present in our lives; just like you might be present with your friends, you 
        have to be present with Him. Daily prayer habits help with that; that's why I use 
        <a href="https://hallow.com/">Hallow</a>, a prayer and meditation app, which can help and 
        remind me to pray (Hallow sadly is not paying me to say this).
    </li>
    <li>We pray wherever we want; the best place is to pray in your room(Mathew 6:6) or space where you can be quiet. 
        A better place to pray is at church (the house of God). Bonus points are if it 
        is doing eucharistic adoration or during mass (the prayer of all prayers).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How do we pray?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
    According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2626-2643), there are five forms of prayers:
<ol>
<li>Blessing or adoration- This is where we acknowledge God as the source of all blessings and express 
    our adoration and worship towards Him. 
</li><li>Petitions - As mentioned before, we bring our needs, desires, and concerns before God 
    and ask for help and guidance as we move forward.
</li><li>Intercession - this form of prayer is where we pray on behalf of others.
     We lift the prayer of others to God and ask for his grace, healing, and blessing upon the person. This is where we can ask" or to entreat others to pray for us. This is done to reflect our love and concern for our neighbor and to be part of a community which God loves
</li><li>Thanksgiving - this form of prayer is where we are thankful to God for His blessings, goodness, 
    and mercy. We acknowledge that God is the source of everything and express our appreciation for His gifts. 
</li><li>Praise - this is a form of prayer that glorifies and exalts God for who 
    he is. We acknowledge his holiness and power. 
   </li></ol> </li>
   <li>
    If someone does not know how to pray these 5 forms, the best way to understand them is by reading the bible. 
    Expressly the psalms, which have a little bit of all 5. These 5 forms provide a way to connect to God. It also serves a unique purpose to help us grow spiritually.
    </li><li>
    How to pray these forms is up to the individual; 
    there isn't a one-size-fits-all, but there are some ways we can all do to help us pray. 
    One important thing is to quiet down and move away from distractions, and when that is done, 
    Just speak to God with your heart. If you do not know what to say, ask God for help. Over the last century, 
    the church has formulated countless prayers to help individuals (which I will occasionally place in the <a href="/prayers">Prayer </a>channel). 
    Common prayers use The Rosary, Lectio Divina, Liturgy of the Hour, Ignatius examen, and more. 
    </li><li>
    As I have said before, prayer is a conversation that must be a two-way street.
     You talk, but you must also listen to the holy spirit in your heart.
      Silence is essential because distraction can hinder us from hearing Him. 
      Sadly, even in the silence, many people cannot seem to hear God. 
      Mother Theresa, for 20 years, was one of them. 
      And Mother Theresa found out that even though she couldn't seem to hear God, He was by her side the whole time.
       God speaks to us in many ways through our actions in the day, through people, through the word of God, and sometimes even 
       through silence and meditation. God does speak to us.
        We need to continue to find Him and have faith in Him and continue to pray.

    <!--<img src="stairs.jpg" alt="stairs" height="25%" width="25%" class = "picture" title = "Stairs I saw at a church">-->

    <p>The Stairway of Opportunity is a stairway filled with hurdles and pain, with endless stairs leading to a wooden door. One day, you decide you want to climb the stairs because everyone has been telling you it will lead to success. So you keep climbing and climbing. Your feet bleed from all the climbing, but remember that there will be success in the end. It takes hours to climb, and you wonder if there is even a door up there. You start having doubts, but you cannot go back down because there is nowhere to go back to. You look behind you, and you see blackness. You ask people for help, but there's little they can do. They can only direct you to keep moving forward. Only you can move your legs. Now you forget why you even went up the stairs; didn't your parents force you to go up? Why blame your parents when it was only your choice to go up? Well, the past is the past; you can't do anything about it. You are almost there, and you lose motivation from the climb, and yet you keep going because you are only so close. Everyone is cheering you on so you can open the door. Finally, you take the last step. And you fell from exhaustion. You cry profusely out of joy and tiredness.

    </p>        
    <p>Before you is a big wooden door, that countless people have walked through, and now it's your turn.
         You rise up; Reach for the handle, and…..it won't open. Is it broken? No, it works fine. Is it locked? 
         No, you actually had the key from the beginning of the journey, so you can open it easily.  And yet you dont insert it. 
         Why? You are finished, what are you waiting for? Everyone is counting on you. But you are scared your legs tremble. 
         You dont know what is behind that door. What if there is misery, what if there's nothing behind the door and just a big wall? 
         Or even worse, what if there are even more stairs to do? You want to go back and relieve the memories of when the door did not exist 
         in your mind. Oh, those were the days of no worries, of no leg problems from going up the stairs. They say Curiosity killed the cat, 
         so what if you are going to die from opening the door….. But you will never know. Sure, it might be nothing,, or it might be something.
          But you will never know because you don't have the courage to open the door and move forward.</p>
    
    <p>All these steps are wasted because of your indecisiveness. Yes, they say, “Curiosity killed the cat,’ 
        but they forget the other end of the sentence “The truth brought it back to life.” Regardless of 
        what is behind that door, it is the truth, and you must own it for better or worse. No whining here! we are grown-ups. 
        yes, time went by, but all we can do is own it. Be in control of what we have and are right now. Do not open the door 
        to make your parents or friends proud, but open it to make yourself proud. Say to yourself, “I DID IT,” “I CONQUERED MY FEAR,” or
         “THIS HARD WORK PAID OFF FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE”. You insert the key. You turn the knob. You open the door and…

    <h3>In the beginning</h3>
    <p>In The beginning, God made man and had a close relationship with man. However, sin entered the world, and man and God's relationship was broken since man disobeyed God. Despised of this, God remained faithful and promised a Savior that could help restore the relationship and be reunited as before</p>
    
    <h3>The Old Covenant</h3>
    <p>Throughout history, God revealed Himself with the help of prophets and made covenants with Humans. His foundation lay with the Israelites, the chosen people. For the coming of the Messiah, God desired people to be prepared so that his plan for salvation could gradually unfold. Despite numerous rebellions, God's mercy prevailed, accepting offerings for sins. However, these sacrifices were insufficient, necessitating the coming of the Messiah.</p>
    
    <h3>The New Covenant</h3>
    <p>In Nazareth, a young woman named Mary received a visitation from an angel announcing that Mary was chosen by God to bear the son of God, the long-awaited Messiah and Savior. Mary accepted the will of God, and Jesus grew to be a great prophet and leader. He performed many miracles and proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God and that people must repent to have eternal life. Jesus also announced the New Covenant that would be established through His death. </p>
    
    <h3>Establishing the church </h3>
    <p>Jesus, through his earthly life, established what is known now as the catholic church. Jesus appointed the apostles as the church's foundation, giving them authority to teach, govern and sanctify in his name. Peter was also given the keys to the kingdom and became vicar of Christ. Furthermore, he gave the apostles authority to forgive sins and consecrate the Eucharist, establishing them as priests.In the end, he got Crucified to save humanity's life from sin. At Pentecost, Jesus ascended, and the holy spirit descended to the apostles, making this the birthday of the church.</p>
    
    <h3>Church Growth and Challenges</h3>
    <p>Over time, the Christian Church grew in numbers and developed its doctrines, rooted in the teachings of Jesus. Initially, Christians worshipped in secret since Christianity was illegal.  Luckily in the 4th century, Emperor Constantine's legalization of Christianity empowered the Church to evangelize openly and grow in numbers. It's important to note that Constantine didn't create the Catholic Church; he simply legalized it.
    </p>
    <p>Over time Councils were convened to establish doctrine, but challenges arose. A notable division occurred in 1054, known as the Great Schism, splitting Christianity into East and West over disagreements on the "filioque" clause and papal authority.
    </p>
    <p>Around the 16th century, Protestant Reformation emerged. This movement, a response to disagreement with Catholic Church teachings with papal authority and to corruption of indulgences, led to various Protestant denominations sprouting.</p>

    <h3>Counter-Reformation and Ongoing Development</h3>
    <p>The 16th Century went into a period called the Post-Reformation, where the church initiated councils to the Catholic Church initiated the Counter-Reformation to address issues addressed in the protestant reformation and also strengthen its doctrinal teachings. Throughout history, The church continues evolving, acknowledging past errors. Even in modern times, challenges persist, including the sexual abuse scandal. However, due to all these challenges, the church doesn't back down and keeps moving forward, spreading the word and keeping the teachings of Jesus alive. </p>

  <p>We are fallen beings, and our destination is to Go to Heaven by Following the Truth</p>
  <p> According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Truth is found in Christ. 
      He is "<i>Full of grace and truth, he came as the "light of the world," he is the Truth. 
      "Whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness." The disciple of Jesus continues in his word to know "the truth [that] 
      will make you free," and that sanctifies.</i>"(CCC 2466).</p>
  <p>It is essential we dont stray away from the Truth or we fall from Darkeness. 
      Because we are fallen beings, temptation creeps around the corner waiting for us to fall. In life, we have distractions,  
      making us unable to move forward and see the light. With the help of the Holy Spirit, we can move forward. 
      With the help of others in the faith, we can move forward. </p>

  <h3><i>My Odyssey</i> by Calvin</h3>
  <pre class="odyssey">
  I open my eyes 
  and the birds are singing in harmony.
  As I drift through the lakes of clouds,
  I meet the little siren 
  who offers me an apple.
  I must refuse and go forth !!
  Poseidon looks at me gaily 
  but his brothers do not.
  Zephyrus blows me toward home
  So I tune a gift for him as an homage
  I finally came and greeted my home 
  And I thank those who have helped me find the path of my odyssey.
  </pre>
