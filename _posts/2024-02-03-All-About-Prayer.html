<h3>What is Prayer?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
    Prayer comes from the root word <em>precari,</em> which means "to ask" or "to entreat" another individual for something.
     One could Pray to Saints or God (we will focus on God today and saints for another time.)
    </li>   
    <li>Many times, when people think of praying to God, they are actually thinking of petitionary prayer, a type of prayer where we ask God for something, such as help, guidance, or blessings.
        But that is not all prayer is. Prayer is a conversion with God through the act of adoration. 
        It is about expressing our relationship with God, where we lift our hearts and minds to him, offering praise, thanksgiving, repentance, and requests.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why do we pray?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>God will answer our prayers most definitely, but sometimes, it is not how we want it. God is not a genie that he grants every command a person makes. God sometimes can say yes or no, or occasionally, we just have to be patient (and then ask for the virtue of patience).
    </li>
    <li>So, what is the point of prayer if sometimes God doesn't answer our prayers? 
        Well, because we need prayer to live. St. John Vianney (cur√© d'Ars), patron saint of priests,
         says, <em>"He who does not pray deprives himself of what is indispensable for life."</em>
            Prayer is like oxygen for our souls; without it, we cannot live. We need God to thrive, 
            and prayer connects us to Him. Without prayer, we won't be close to God, and when we are not
             close to God, evil and temptations will engulf us and lead us into a path of sin. As St. Paul 
             says, <em>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
              let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep 
              your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."</em>(Philippians 4:6-7). When we pray, we put our trust in God to make 
              everything alright, and in doing so, we keep our hearts and minds to God and be on the path of holiness. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>When (and where) do we pray</h3> 

<ul>
    <li>Just like we need oxygen constantly, we need to pray continuously. 
        As St. Paul said, <em>"Pray without ceasing"</em>(1 Thessalonians 5:17); 
        now, that doesn't mean to be like a monk and pray 24/7, but it means that 
        throughout your day, you need God to be present in your life. The prayer can 
        last an hour to even 5 seconds. From when you wake up in the morning to when you go 
        outside; When you eat your meals to when you have to study, cry, laugh. God must 
        be present in our lives; just like you might be present with your friends, you 
        have to be present with Him. Daily prayer habits help with that; that's why I use 
        <a href="https://hallow.com/">Hallow</a>, a prayer and meditation app, which can help and 
        remind me to pray (Hallow sadly is not paying me to say this).
    </li>
    <li>We pray wherever we want; the best place is to pray in your room(Mathew 6:6) or space where you can be quiet. 
        A better place to pray is at church (the house of God). Bonus points are if it 
        is doing eucharistic adoration or during mass (the prayer of all prayers).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How do we pray?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
    According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2626-2643), there are five forms of prayers:
<ol>
<li>Blessing or adoration- This is where we acknowledge God as the source of all blessings and express 
    our adoration and worship towards Him. 
</li><li>Petitions - As mentioned before, we bring our needs, desires, and concerns before God 
    and ask for help and guidance as we move forward.
</li><li>Intercession - this form of prayer is where we pray on behalf of others.
     We lift the prayer of others to God and ask for his grace, healing, and blessing upon the person. This is where we can ask" or to entreat others to pray for us. This is done to reflect our love and concern for our neighbor and to be part of a community which God loves
</li><li>Thanksgiving - this form of prayer is where we are thankful to God for His blessings, goodness, 
    and mercy. We acknowledge that God is the source of everything and express our appreciation for His gifts. 
</li><li>Praise - this is a form of prayer that glorifies and exalts God for who 
    he is. We acknowledge his holiness and power. 
   </li></ol> </li>
   <li>
    If someone does not know how to pray these 5 forms, the best way to understand them is by reading the bible. 
    Expressly the psalms, which have a little bit of all 5. These 5 forms provide a way to connect to God. It also serves a unique purpose to help us grow spiritually.
    </li><li>
    How to pray these forms is up to the individual; 
    there isn't a one-size-fits-all, but there are some ways we can all do to help us pray. 
    One important thing is to quiet down and move away from distractions, and when that is done, 
    Just speak to God with your heart. If you do not know what to say, ask God for help. Over the last century, 
    the church has formulated countless prayers to help individuals (which I will occasionally place in the <a href="{{ '/prayers' | relative_url }}">Prayer </a>channel). 
    Common prayers use The Rosary, Lectio Divina, Liturgy of the Hour, Ignatius examen, and more. 
    </li><li>
    As I have said before, prayer is a conversation that must be a two-way street.
     You talk, but you must also listen to the holy spirit in your heart.
      Silence is essential because distraction can hinder us from hearing Him. 
      Sadly, even in the silence, many people cannot seem to hear God. 
      Mother Theresa, for 20 years, was one of them. 
      And Mother Theresa found out that even though she couldn't seem to hear God, He was by her side the whole time.
       God speaks to us in many ways through our actions in the day, through people, through the word of God, and sometimes even 
       through silence and meditation. God does speak to us.
        We need to continue to find Him and have faith in Him and continue to pray.
