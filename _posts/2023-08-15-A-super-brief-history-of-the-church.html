    <h3>In the beginning</h3>
    <p>In The beginning, God made man and had a close relationship with man. However, sin entered the world, and man and God's relationship was broken since man disobeyed God. Despised of this, God remained faithful and promised a Savior that could help restore the relationship and be reunited as before</p>
    
    <h3>The Old Covenant</h3>
    <p>Throughout history, God revealed Himself with the help of prophets and made covenants with Humans. His foundation lay with the Israelites, the chosen people. For the coming of the Messiah, God desired people to be prepared so that his plan for salvation could gradually unfold. Despite numerous rebellions, God's mercy prevailed, accepting offerings for sins. However, these sacrifices were insufficient, necessitating the coming of the Messiah.</p>
    
    <h3>The New Covenant</h3>
    <p>In Nazareth, a young woman named Mary received a visitation from an angel announcing that Mary was chosen by God to bear the son of God, the long-awaited Messiah and Savior. Mary accepted the will of God, and Jesus grew to be a great prophet and leader. He performed many miracles and proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God and that people must repent to have eternal life. Jesus also announced the New Covenant that would be established through His death. </p>
    
    <h3>Establishing the church </h3>
    <p>Jesus, through his earthly life, established what is known now as the catholic church. Jesus appointed the apostles as the church's foundation, giving them authority to teach, govern and sanctify in his name. Peter was also given the keys to the kingdom and became vicar of Christ. Furthermore, he gave the apostles authority to forgive sins and consecrate the Eucharist, establishing them as priests.In the end, he got Crucified to save humanity's life from sin. At Pentecost, Jesus ascended, and the holy spirit descended to the apostles, making this the birthday of the church.</p>
    
    <h3>Church Growth and Challenges</h3>
    <p>Over time, the Christian Church grew in numbers and developed its doctrines, rooted in the teachings of Jesus. Initially, Christians worshipped in secret since Christianity was illegal.  Luckily in the 4th century, Emperor Constantine's legalization of Christianity empowered the Church to evangelize openly and grow in numbers. It's important to note that Constantine didn't create the Catholic Church; he simply legalized it.
    </p>
    <p>Over time Councils were convened to establish doctrine, but challenges arose. A notable division occurred in 1054, known as the Great Schism, splitting Christianity into East and West over disagreements on the "filioque" clause and papal authority.
    </p>
    <p>Around the 16th century, Protestant Reformation emerged. This movement, a response to disagreement with Catholic Church teachings with papal authority and to corruption of indulgences, led to various Protestant denominations sprouting.</p>

    <h3>Counter-Reformation and Ongoing Development</h3>
    <p>The 16th Century went into a period called the Post-Reformation, where the church initiated councils to the Catholic Church initiated the Counter-Reformation to address issues addressed in the protestant reformation and also strengthen its doctrinal teachings. Throughout history, The church continues evolving, acknowledging past errors. Even in modern times, challenges persist, including the sexual abuse scandal. However, due to all these challenges, the church doesn't back down and keeps moving forward, spreading the word and keeping the teachings of Jesus alive. </p>
