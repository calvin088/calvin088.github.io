    <p>The Stairway of Opportunity is a stairway filled with hurdles and pain, with endless stairs leading to a wooden door. One day, you decide you want to climb the stairs because everyone has been telling you it will lead to success. So you keep climbing and climbing. Your feet bleed from all the climbing, but remember that there will be success in the end. It takes hours to climb, and you wonder if there is even a door up there. You start having doubts, but you cannot go back down because there is nowhere to go back to. You look behind you, and you see blackness. You ask people for help, but there's little they can do. They can only direct you to keep moving forward. Only you can move your legs. Now you forget why you even went up the stairs; didn't your parents force you to go up? Why blame your parents when it was only your choice to go up? Well, the past is the past; you can't do anything about it. You are almost there, and you lose motivation from the climb, and yet you keep going because you are only so close. Everyone is cheering you on so you can open the door. Finally, you take the last step. And you fell from exhaustion. You cry profusely out of joy and tiredness.

    </p>        
    <p>Before you is a big wooden door, that countless people have walked through, and now it's your turn.
         You rise up; Reach for the handle, and…..it won't open. Is it broken? No, it works fine. Is it locked? 
         No, you actually had the key from the beginning of the journey, so you can open it easily.  And yet you dont insert it. 
         Why? You are finished, what are you waiting for? Everyone is counting on you. But you are scared your legs tremble. 
         You dont know what is behind that door. What if there is misery, what if there's nothing behind the door and just a big wall? 
         Or even worse, what if there are even more stairs to do? You want to go back and relieve the memories of when the door did not exist 
         in your mind. Oh, those were the days of no worries, of no leg problems from going up the stairs. They say Curiosity killed the cat, 
         so what if you are going to die from opening the door….. But you will never know. Sure, it might be nothing,, or it might be something.
          But you will never know because you don't have the courage to open the door and move forward.</p>
    
    <p>All these steps are wasted because of your indecisiveness. Yes, they say, “Curiosity killed the cat,’ 
        but they forget the other end of the sentence “The truth brought it back to life.” Regardless of 
        what is behind that door, it is the truth, and you must own it for better or worse. No whining here! we are grown-ups. 
        yes, time went by, but all we can do is own it. Be in control of what we have and are right now. Do not open the door 
        to make your parents or friends proud, but open it to make yourself proud. Say to yourself, “I DID IT,” “I CONQUERED MY FEAR,” or
         “THIS HARD WORK PAID OFF FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE”. You insert the key. You turn the knob. You open the door and…
