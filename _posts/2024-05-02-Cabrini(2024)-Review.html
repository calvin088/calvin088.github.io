<p>On the day I viewed Cabrini (2024), I was walking down the streets of the east side of New York City, marveling at the buildings and people. 
    Having arrived in America a decade ago, I am still struck by the grand architecture and all the opportunities found in the city. There’s so 
    much culture in every spot of the city, and it doesn't matter where you go, you'll find something new to discover. While it certainly has 
    drawbacks and downfalls, it remains a beacon of opportunity, drawing people from all walks of life. In my journey in the city, I am reminded 
    that this city was made by hardworking immigrants who traveled and abandoned their old lives to find a new one. Cabrini (2024) is a testament 
    to what immigrants (more specifically Italian immigrants) had to endure.

<p>Cabrini(2024) is a biopic of the first canonized American saint, St. Frances Xavier Cabrini. 
    St. Frances Xavier Cabrini was born Maria Francesca Cabrini on July 15, 1850, in Sant'Angelo Lodigiano, Lombardy, Italy. 
    She was deeply devoted to her faith from a young age, desiring to join a religious order by age 18. However, her vocation faced 
    challenges due to her health. She eventually joined the religious order of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and was appointed 
    as the headmistress of an orphanage in Italy. Later, her bishop asked her and other sisters to build the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred 
    Heart to care for poor children in schools and hospitals. The institute established seven homes, a free school, and a nursery in just five 
    years.

    Her zeal for helping the poor and sick led her to desire to continue her mission in China. 
    However, under the guidance of Pope Leo XIII, she was ordered to continue her mission in the West, 
    specifically in the United States, where an influx of Italian immigrants needed assistance. Upon her 
    arrival in New York, she encountered poverty among Italian children and faced racism alongside her order 
    and the children they served. She accomplished her goal through hard work and faith in God and founded 67 
    institutions worldwide, including in China.

<p>
St. Xavier passed away at 67 and was canonized by Pope Pius XII on July 7, 1946. Her feast day is celebrated on November 13,
 and she is revered as the patron saint of immigrants.The film does a remarkable job of representing Mother Cabrini and her work.
  It effectively portrays the struggles faced by Italian immigrants in the late 1800s, a topic often overlooked in cinema. Everything 
  from the script to the captions and lighting was executed perfectly.

    The movie conveys the message that hard work can lead to outstanding achievements. While some criticized the film as being 
    just another boring feminist movie—a story of women standing against the government or the church—it truly reflects the struggle 
    of immigrants against those in power. It also showed the dichotomy between new immigrants and old immigrants. Where the old immigrants 
    already have a life for themselves but are filled with pride, they discriminate against the new immigrants. Cabrini's efforts went beyond 
    assisting poor Italian migrants; she humanized Italian immigrants and shed light on their needs. Mother Cabrini helped the children in 
    Five Points by saying, "Rats have it better than the children in Five Points," which was a statement Mother Cabrini published in the 
    newspaper for the rich men and women of New York to see.

    Another criticism people have is that, despite being a faith-based movie, there is not much mention of Jesus or prayer. 
    While I agree that the movie could have done a better job in this aspect, sometimes fewer words can be more potent than more. 
    As St. Francis allegedly said, "Preach often, sometimes use words." Her actions of helping people experiencing poverty reflect
     what Jesus would do to serve others in need. As Jesus had said, “'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of 
     these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”(Mathew 25:40). The works that Jesus encourages us to do for the poor not 
     only help the person but it also helps you be more connected to God.

    Cabrini (2024) is a movie that the whole family can enjoy, regardless of class, religion, culture, political belief, etc.… 
    It taught me that if you have faith in God, you can accomplish anything, no matter how difficult the task is. It also taught 
    me that one should not be talked down and must stand up for what they believe.  Cabrini (2024) was an emotional movie that made me 
    feel that I needed some tissues on my side.
